# Alzheimer Detection

## 📌 Overview
Alzheimer Detection is a project that utilizes **Mediapipe** and **Machine Learning** to analyze and predict Alzheimer's disease through posture detection and cognitive exercises. Users can input data and receive real-time assessments.

## 🚀 Features
- 🔍 **Posture Detection** using Mediapipe to analyze movement patterns.
- 🧠 **Alzheimer's Risk Analysis** with **Naive Bayes** for early-stage prediction.
- 🎮 **Memory and Cognitive Games** to engage users:
  - **Number Recall Game**: Users memorize a sequence of numbers and recall them.
  - **Hand Gesture Quiz**: Users raise their hands to answer questions.
  - **Other interactive exercises** to test cognitive function.
- 📊 **Results Visualization** with an easy-to-use UI.
- 🏥 **Health Assistance** to allow users to perform self-assessment.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Flask** (Backend)
- **Mediapipe** (Posture and gesture detection)
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine Learning)
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** (Frontend UI)
